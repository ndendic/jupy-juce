If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.\\n\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: \\n  - Uses an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.\\n  - Returns `1` if `n` is `0` (the factorial of 0 is 1).\\n  - Uses a for-loop to compute the factorial for positive integers.\\n\\n- **Example Usage**: \\n  - Demonstrates the function by calculating the factorial of 5.\\n  - Includes a try-except block to catch and print the error message if a `ValueError` is raised when computing the factorial of a negative number.\\n\\nYou can execute the cell to see how it works or modify it to test with other values.\", part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 48, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n find_current_notebook ()\n\n*Find and cache the current notebook data.\nReturns: Dict containing notebook data or None if not found*\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n get_notebook_history (max_cells:int=10)\n\n*Get the content of notebook cells between current and last prompt cell.\nArgs: max_cells: Maximum number of previous cells to include\nReturns: List of previous cell contents*\nTesting notebook history\n\nnb_hist = get_notebook_history(max_cells=20)\nnb_hist\n\n[\"Cell[7]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom typing import cast\\nmodel = cast(KnownModelName, os.getenv('PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL', 'openai:gpt-4o'))\\nprint(f'PydanticAI is using model: {model}')\\nnotebook_agent = Agent(model, system_prompt=system_prompt)\\nOutputs:\\n[{'name': 'stdout', 'output_type': 'stream', 'text': ['PydanticAI is using model: openai:gpt-4o\\\\n']}]\",\n 'Cell[8]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n_current_agent: Optional[Agent] = None\\n\\ndef get_current_agent() -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Get the current agent, falling back to default notebook_agent if none set.\"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n    return _current_agent or notebook_agent\\n\\nOutputs:\\n[]',\n 'Cell[9]:\\nSource:\\n## Agent tools\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[10]:\\nSource:\\n### Create cell tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[11]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\\nfrom typing import Literal\\n\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef create_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], content: str, cell_type: Literal[\\'code\\', \\'markdown\\'] = \\'code\\') -&gt; str:\\n    \"\"\"Create a new cell in the notebook with the specified content.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        content: The content to put in the new cell\\n        cell_type: Type of cell to create (\\'code\\' or \\'markdown\\')\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        A confirmation message\\n    \"\"\"\\n    try:    \\n        ipython = get_ipython()\\n    except NameError:\\n        return \"Error: Not running in IPython/Jupyter environment\"\\n    \\n    # Display the content immediately\\n    if cell_type == \\'code\\':\\n        # Set up the next cell with the content\\n        ipython.set_next_input(content)\\n    else:\\n        display(Markdown(content))\\n    \\n    return f\"Created new {cell_type}  with content: {content}\"\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'name\\': \\'stderr\\', \\'output_type\\': \\'stream\\', \\'text\\': [\\'&lt;module&gt;:8: No type or annotation for returned value 1\\\\n\\']}]',\n 'Cell[12]:\\nSource:\\nAlways set custom agents to inherit base tools\\n\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[13]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\ndef set_agent(agent: Agent) -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Set a custom agent for the notebook.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        agent: PydanticAI agent instance\\n        \\n    Returns:\\n        Configured agent with required tools\\n    \"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n        \\n    # Always ensure create_cell tool is available\\n    if \\'create_cell\\' not in agent._function_tools:\\n        # Copy the tool directly from notebook_agent\\n        agent._function_tools = notebook_agent._function_tools\\n    \\n    _current_agent = agent\\n    return agent\\nOutputs:\\n[]',\n 'Cell[14]:\\nSource:\\nTool testing cell creation tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[15]:\\nSource:\\nresult = notebook_agent.run_sync(\\'can you create me a simple hello world functio in a new celland make sure I can run it right away to see the output?\\')\\nMarkdown(result.data)\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/markdown\\': [\\'I\\\\\\'ve created a new cell with a simple \"Hello, World!\" function.

If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.\\n\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: \\n  - Uses an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.\\n  - Returns `1` if `n` is `0` (the factorial of 0 is 1).\\n  - Uses a for-loop to compute the factorial for positive integers.\\n\\n- **Example Usage**: \\n  - Demonstrates the function by calculating the factorial of 5.\\n  - Includes a try-except block to catch and print the error message if a `ValueError` is raised when computing the factorial of a negative number.\\n\\nYou can execute the cell to see how it works or modify it to test with other values.\", part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 48, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response'),\n  ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Here is the context of new notebook cells that were added:\\nCell[11]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\\nfrom typing import Literal\\n\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef create_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], content: str, cell_type: Literal[\\'code\\', \\'markdown\\'] = \\'code\\') -&gt; str:\\n    \"\"\"Create a new cell in the notebook with the specified content.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        content: The content to put in the new cell\\n        cell_type: Type of cell to create (\\'code\\' or \\'markdown\\')\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        A confirmation message\\n    \"\"\"\\n    try:    \\n        ipython = get_ipython()\\n    except NameError:\\n        return \"Error: Not running in IPython/Jupyter environment\"\\n    \\n    # Display the content immediately\\n    if cell_type == \\'code\\':\\n        # Set up the next cell with the content\\n        ipython.set_next_input(content)\\n    else:\\n        display(Markdown(content))\\n    \\n    return f\"Created new {cell_type}  with content: {content}\"\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'name\\': \\'stderr\\', \\'output_type\\': \\'stream\\', \\'text\\': [\\'&lt;module&gt;:8: No type or annotation for returned value 1\\\\n\\']}]\\n\\nCell[12]:\\nSource:\\nAlways set custom agents to inherit base tools\\n\\nOutputs:\\nNone\\n\\nCell[13]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\ndef set_agent(agent: Agent) -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Set a custom agent for the notebook.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        agent: PydanticAI agent instance\\n        \\n    Returns:\\n        Configured agent with required tools\\n    \"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n        \\n    # Always ensure create_cell tool is available\\n    if \\'create_cell\\' not in agent._function_tools:\\n        # Copy the tool directly from notebook_agent\\n        agent._function_tools = notebook_agent._function_tools\\n    \\n    _current_agent = agent\\n    return agent\\nOutputs:\\n[]\\n\\nCell[14]:\\nSource:\\nTool testing cell creation tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone\\n\\nCell[15]:\\nSource:\\nresult = notebook_agent.run_sync(\\'can you create me a simple hello world functio in a new celland make sure I can run it right away to see the output?\\')\\nMarkdown(result.data)\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/markdown\\': [\\'I\\\\\\'ve created a new cell with a simple \"Hello, World!\" function.

Examples include requests to create a ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù function and a factorial function with input validation.\n\nFunction Implementation:\n\nFunctions like hello_world() and factorial() are defined as part of this process. The factorial function includes input validation and uses recursion to calculate factorials.\n\nNotebook History and Prompt Management:\n\nThere are methods for capturing the history of cell executions and creating context-aware prompts that consider both the current notebook state and any previous interactions or commands.\n\nExecution Testing:\n\nVarious cells are used to test the system, ensure that functionality is operating correctly, and demonstrate the capabilities of the conversational agent in a Jupyter context.\n\nError Handling and Validation:\n\nThe notebook handles potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs for the factorial function) and various elements of cell execution and output display.\n\nHistory Creation and Contextual Responses:\n\nAn advanced feature is the creation of context-aware prompts that adapt based on the content and history of the notebook, indicating a sophisticated interaction system between user inputs and the agent‚Äôs responses.\n\n\nIn summary, the notebook combines Jupyter‚Äôs interactive capabilities with an AI-driven agent to assist with tasks, automatically manage notebook content, and potentially perform more complex logical operations based on the commands or tasks provided by the user.\n\n\n\nresult.all_messages()\n\n[ModelRequest(parts=[SystemPromptPart(content=\"\\nYou are a helpful assistant that operates in a Jupyter notebook.\\nYour regular text responses are rendered as cell output.\\nYou can create new cells, edit existing cells, and run code.\\nYou can also use tools to help you with your tasks.\\nToday's date is 2024-12-31.\\n\", part_kind='system-prompt'), UserPromptPart(content='Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 43, 700768, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind='user-prompt')], kind='request'),\n ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart(tool_name='create_cell', args=ArgsJson(args_json='{\"content\":\"def factorial(n):\\\\n    \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.\\\\n    \\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\n    \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n    # Input validation\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\"Input must be an integer.\\\\\")\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\\\\\")\\\\n    \\\\n    # Base case\\\\n    if n == 0:\\\\n        return 1\\\\n    \\\\n    # Recursive case\\\\n    result = 1\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\n        result *= i\\\\n    return result\\\\n\\\\n# Example usage\\\\ntry:\\\\n    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120\\\\n    print(factorial(-1)) # Should raise a ValueError\\\\nexcept ValueError as e:\\\\n    print(e)\",\"cell_type\":\"code\"}'), tool_call_id='call_dP852a9HSFo4HgyvUTm6NtHd', part_kind='tool-call')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 44, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response'),\n ModelRequest(parts=[ToolReturnPart(tool_name='create_cell', content='Created new code  with content: def factorial(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.\\n    \\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\n    :return: factorial of n\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Input validation\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\\n    \\n    # Base case\\n    if n == 0:\\n        return 1\\n    \\n    # Recursive case\\n    result = 1\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\n        result *= i\\n    return result\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntry:\\n    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120\\n    print(factorial(-1)) # Should raise a ValueError\\nexcept ValueError as e:\\n    print(e)', tool_call_id='call_dP852a9HSFo4HgyvUTm6NtHd', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 47, 279330, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind='tool-return')], kind='request'),\n ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='I created a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation.

If the input is a negative integer, it raises a `ValueError`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: It calculates the factorial using a recursive approach.

Examples include requests to create a \"Hello, World!\" function and a factorial function with input validation.\\n\\n5. **Function Implementation**:\\n   - Functions like `hello_world()` and `factorial()` are defined as part of this process. The `factorial` function includes input validation and uses recursion to calculate factorials.\\n\\n6. **Notebook History and Prompt Management**:\\n   - There are methods for capturing the history of cell executions and creating context-aware prompts that consider both the current notebook state and any previous interactions or commands.\\n\\n7. **Execution Testing**:\\n   - Various cells are used to test the system, ensure that functionality is operating correctly, and demonstrate the capabilities of the conversational agent in a Jupyter context.\\n\\n8. **Error Handling and Validation**:\\n   - The notebook handles potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs for the factorial function) and various elements of cell execution and output display.\\n\\n9. **History Creation and Contextual Responses**:\\n   - An advanced feature is the creation of context-aware prompts that adapt based on the content and history of the notebook, indicating a sophisticated interaction system between user inputs and the agent‚Äôs responses.\\n\\nIn summary, the notebook combines Jupyter\\'s interactive capabilities with an AI-driven agent to assist with tasks, automatically manage notebook content, and potentially perform more complex logical operations based on the commands or tasks provided by the user.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 53, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n prompt (line, cell)\n\nCell magic to create prompt cells that interact with the AI agent.\n\nwhat this notebook is all about?\n\nThis notebook appears to be part of a system that uses an AI agent to automate tasks within a Jupyter notebook. Here are some key points:\n\nAI Agent Integration: The notebook is integrating a Pydantic AI model, specifically an agent that seems to respond to prompts and perform tasks within the notebook environment.\nFunction Definitions: Several Python functions have been defined:\n\nfactorial(): This function calculates the factorial of a number with input validation.\nhello_world(): A simple function that prints ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.\n\nCell Creation and Management: There are functions and tools implemented to create and manage notebook cells programmatically. For example, the create_cell function uses the IPython‚Äôs API to insert new cells.\nNotebook History Management: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\nHistory-Aware Prompts: Functions like create_history_aware_prompt are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\nTesting and Execution: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\n\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\n\n\n\nlast_prompt_result.all_messages()\n\n[ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Here is the context of new notebook cells that were added:\\nCell[36]:\\nSource:\\nresult.all_messages()\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/plain\\': [\\'[ModelRequest(parts=[SystemPromptPart(content=\"\\\\\\\\nYou are a helpful assistant that operates in a Jupyter notebook.\\\\\\\\nYour regular text responses are rendered as cell output.\\\\\\\\nYou can create new cells, edit existing cells, and run code.\\\\\\\\nYou can also use tools to help you with your tasks.\\\\\\\\nToday\\\\\\'s date is 2024-12-31.\\\\\\\\n\", part_kind=\\\\\\'system-prompt\\\\\\'), UserPromptPart(content=\\\\\\'Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation\\\\\\', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 28, 691513, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind=\\\\\\'user-prompt\\\\\\')], kind=\\\\\\'request\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \\' ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart(tool_name=\\\\\\'create_cell\\\\\\', args=ArgsJson(args_json=\\\\\\'{\"content\":\"def factorial(n):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n with input validation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :raises ValueError: if n is not a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Input must be an integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Input must be a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        return 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    result = 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        result *= i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    return result\",\"cell_type\":\"code\"}\\\\\\'), tool_call_id=\\\\\\'call_Iuc8vC4Y2axuMDvDh3TlF9mz\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'tool-call\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 29, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \\' ModelRequest(parts=[ToolReturnPart(tool_name=\\\\\\'create_cell\\\\\\', content=\\\\\\'Created new code  with content: def factorial(n):\\\\\\\\n    \"\"\"\\\\\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n with input validation.\\\\\\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\\\\\n    :raises ValueError: if n is not a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\n    \"\"\"\\\\\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer\")\\\\\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer\")\\\\\\\\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\\\\\\\n        return 1\\\\\\\\n    result = 1\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        result *= i\\\\\\\\n    return result\\\\\\', tool_call_id=\\\\\\'call_Iuc8vC4Y2axuMDvDh3TlF9mz\\\\\\', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 32, 646314, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind=\\\\\\'tool-return\\\\\\')], kind=\\\\\\'request\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \" ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content=\\'I have created a function to calculate the factorial of a number with input validation.

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\'s API to insert new cells.\\n\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\n\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\n\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\n\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 11, 33, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\ntell me what have I added last to this notebook?\n\n\"Error processing prompt: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Request too large for gpt-4o in organization org-Pm8WC2pvJDhMF1KkAgUCByZl on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 30000, Requested 62420.

If the input is a negative integer, it raises a `ValueError`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: It calculates the factorial using a recursive approach. The base case is that the factorial of 0 is 1, and for other numbers, it uses the recursive definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\( n! = n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\times (n-1)! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo make use of this function, you would call it with an integer argument, like so:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfactorial(5)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis would return `120`, which is the factorial of 5.

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\'s API to insert new cells.\\n\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\n\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\n\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\n\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 11, 33, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]",

If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.\\n\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: \\n  - Uses an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.\\n  - Returns `1` if `n` is `0` (the factorial of 0 is 1).\\n  - Uses a for-loop to compute the factorial for positive integers.\\n\\n- **Example Usage**: \\n  - Demonstrates the function by calculating the factorial of 5.\\n  - Includes a try-except block to catch and print the error message if a `ValueError` is raised when computing the factorial of a negative number.\\n\\nYou can execute the cell to see how it works or modify it to test with other values.\", part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 48, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n find_current_notebook ()\n\n*Find and cache the current notebook data.\nReturns: Dict containing notebook data or None if not found*\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n get_notebook_history (max_cells:int=10)\n\n*Get the content of notebook cells between current and last prompt cell.\nArgs: max_cells: Maximum number of previous cells to include\nReturns: List of previous cell contents*\nTesting notebook history\n\nnb_hist = get_notebook_history(max_cells=20)\nnb_hist\n\n[\"Cell[7]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom typing import cast\\nmodel = cast(KnownModelName, os.getenv('PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL', 'openai:gpt-4o'))\\nprint(f'PydanticAI is using model: {model}')\\nnotebook_agent = Agent(model, system_prompt=system_prompt)\\nOutputs:\\n[{'name': 'stdout', 'output_type': 'stream', 'text': ['PydanticAI is using model: openai:gpt-4o\\\\n']}]\",\n 'Cell[8]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n_current_agent: Optional[Agent] = None\\n\\ndef get_current_agent() -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Get the current agent, falling back to default notebook_agent if none set.\"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n    return _current_agent or notebook_agent\\n\\nOutputs:\\n[]',\n 'Cell[9]:\\nSource:\\n## Agent tools\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[10]:\\nSource:\\n### Create cell tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[11]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\\nfrom typing import Literal\\n\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef create_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], content: str, cell_type: Literal[\\'code\\', \\'markdown\\'] = \\'code\\') -&gt; str:\\n    \"\"\"Create a new cell in the notebook with the specified content.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        content: The content to put in the new cell\\n        cell_type: Type of cell to create (\\'code\\' or \\'markdown\\')\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        A confirmation message\\n    \"\"\"\\n    try:    \\n        ipython = get_ipython()\\n    except NameError:\\n        return \"Error: Not running in IPython/Jupyter environment\"\\n    \\n    # Display the content immediately\\n    if cell_type == \\'code\\':\\n        # Set up the next cell with the content\\n        ipython.set_next_input(content)\\n    else:\\n        display(Markdown(content))\\n    \\n    return f\"Created new {cell_type}  with content: {content}\"\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'name\\': \\'stderr\\', \\'output_type\\': \\'stream\\', \\'text\\': [\\'&lt;module&gt;:8: No type or annotation for returned value 1\\\\n\\']}]',\n 'Cell[12]:\\nSource:\\nAlways set custom agents to inherit base tools\\n\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[13]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\ndef set_agent(agent: Agent) -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Set a custom agent for the notebook.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        agent: PydanticAI agent instance\\n        \\n    Returns:\\n        Configured agent with required tools\\n    \"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n        \\n    # Always ensure create_cell tool is available\\n    if \\'create_cell\\' not in agent._function_tools:\\n        # Copy the tool directly from notebook_agent\\n        agent._function_tools = notebook_agent._function_tools\\n    \\n    _current_agent = agent\\n    return agent\\nOutputs:\\n[]',\n 'Cell[14]:\\nSource:\\nTool testing cell creation tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone',\n 'Cell[15]:\\nSource:\\nresult = notebook_agent.run_sync(\\'can you create me a simple hello world functio in a new celland make sure I can run it right away to see the output?\\')\\nMarkdown(result.data)\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/markdown\\': [\\'I\\\\\\'ve created a new cell with a simple \"Hello, World!\" function.

If `n` is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.\\n\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: \\n  - Uses an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.\\n  - Returns `1` if `n` is `0` (the factorial of 0 is 1).\\n  - Uses a for-loop to compute the factorial for positive integers.\\n\\n- **Example Usage**: \\n  - Demonstrates the function by calculating the factorial of 5.\\n  - Includes a try-except block to catch and print the error message if a `ValueError` is raised when computing the factorial of a negative number.\\n\\nYou can execute the cell to see how it works or modify it to test with other values.\", part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 48, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response'),\n  ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Here is the context of new notebook cells that were added:\\nCell[11]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\\nfrom typing import Literal\\n\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef create_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], content: str, cell_type: Literal[\\'code\\', \\'markdown\\'] = \\'code\\') -&gt; str:\\n    \"\"\"Create a new cell in the notebook with the specified content.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        content: The content to put in the new cell\\n        cell_type: Type of cell to create (\\'code\\' or \\'markdown\\')\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        A confirmation message\\n    \"\"\"\\n    try:    \\n        ipython = get_ipython()\\n    except NameError:\\n        return \"Error: Not running in IPython/Jupyter environment\"\\n    \\n    # Display the content immediately\\n    if cell_type == \\'code\\':\\n        # Set up the next cell with the content\\n        ipython.set_next_input(content)\\n    else:\\n        display(Markdown(content))\\n    \\n    return f\"Created new {cell_type}  with content: {content}\"\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'name\\': \\'stderr\\', \\'output_type\\': \\'stream\\', \\'text\\': [\\'&lt;module&gt;:8: No type or annotation for returned value 1\\\\n\\']}]\\n\\nCell[12]:\\nSource:\\nAlways set custom agents to inherit base tools\\n\\nOutputs:\\nNone\\n\\nCell[13]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\ndef set_agent(agent: Agent) -&gt; Agent:\\n    \"\"\"Set a custom agent for the notebook.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        agent: PydanticAI agent instance\\n        \\n    Returns:\\n        Configured agent with required tools\\n    \"\"\"\\n    global _current_agent, notebook_agent\\n        \\n    # Always ensure create_cell tool is available\\n    if \\'create_cell\\' not in agent._function_tools:\\n        # Copy the tool directly from notebook_agent\\n        agent._function_tools = notebook_agent._function_tools\\n    \\n    _current_agent = agent\\n    return agent\\nOutputs:\\n[]\\n\\nCell[14]:\\nSource:\\nTool testing cell creation tool\\nOutputs:\\nNone\\n\\nCell[15]:\\nSource:\\nresult = notebook_agent.run_sync(\\'can you create me a simple hello world functio in a new celland make sure I can run it right away to see the output?\\')\\nMarkdown(result.data)\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/markdown\\': [\\'I\\\\\\'ve created a new cell with a simple \"Hello, World!\" function.

Examples include requests to create a ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù function and a factorial function with input validation.\n\nFunction Implementation:\n\nFunctions like hello_world() and factorial() are defined as part of this process. The factorial function includes input validation and uses recursion to calculate factorials.\n\nNotebook History and Prompt Management:\n\nThere are methods for capturing the history of cell executions and creating context-aware prompts that consider both the current notebook state and any previous interactions or commands.\n\nExecution Testing:\n\nVarious cells are used to test the system, ensure that functionality is operating correctly, and demonstrate the capabilities of the conversational agent in a Jupyter context.\n\nError Handling and Validation:\n\nThe notebook handles potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs for the factorial function) and various elements of cell execution and output display.\n\nHistory Creation and Contextual Responses:\n\nAn advanced feature is the creation of context-aware prompts that adapt based on the content and history of the notebook, indicating a sophisticated interaction system between user inputs and the agent‚Äôs responses.\n\n\nIn summary, the notebook combines Jupyter‚Äôs interactive capabilities with an AI-driven agent to assist with tasks, automatically manage notebook content, and potentially perform more complex logical operations based on the commands or tasks provided by the user.\n\n\n\nresult.all_messages()\n\n[ModelRequest(parts=[SystemPromptPart(content=\"\\nYou are a helpful assistant that operates in a Jupyter notebook.\\nYour regular text responses are rendered as cell output.\\nYou can create new cells, edit existing cells, and run code.\\nYou can also use tools to help you with your tasks.\\nToday's date is 2024-12-31.\\n\", part_kind='system-prompt'), UserPromptPart(content='Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 43, 700768, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind='user-prompt')], kind='request'),\n ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart(tool_name='create_cell', args=ArgsJson(args_json='{\"content\":\"def factorial(n):\\\\n    \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.\\\\n    \\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\n    \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n    # Input validation\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\"Input must be an integer.\\\\\")\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\\\\\")\\\\n    \\\\n    # Base case\\\\n    if n == 0:\\\\n        return 1\\\\n    \\\\n    # Recursive case\\\\n    result = 1\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\n        result *= i\\\\n    return result\\\\n\\\\n# Example usage\\\\ntry:\\\\n    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120\\\\n    print(factorial(-1)) # Should raise a ValueError\\\\nexcept ValueError as e:\\\\n    print(e)\",\"cell_type\":\"code\"}'), tool_call_id='call_dP852a9HSFo4HgyvUTm6NtHd', part_kind='tool-call')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 44, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response'),\n ModelRequest(parts=[ToolReturnPart(tool_name='create_cell', content='Created new code  with content: def factorial(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.\\n    \\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\n    :return: factorial of n\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Input validation\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\\n    \\n    # Base case\\n    if n == 0:\\n        return 1\\n    \\n    # Recursive case\\n    result = 1\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\n        result *= i\\n    return result\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntry:\\n    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120\\n    print(factorial(-1)) # Should raise a ValueError\\nexcept ValueError as e:\\n    print(e)', tool_call_id='call_dP852a9HSFo4HgyvUTm6NtHd', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 47, 279330, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind='tool-return')], kind='request'),\n ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='I created a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation.

If the input is a negative integer, it raises a `ValueError`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: It calculates the factorial using a recursive approach.

Examples include requests to create a \"Hello, World!\" function and a factorial function with input validation.\\n\\n5. **Function Implementation**:\\n   - Functions like `hello_world()` and `factorial()` are defined as part of this process. The `factorial` function includes input validation and uses recursion to calculate factorials.\\n\\n6. **Notebook History and Prompt Management**:\\n   - There are methods for capturing the history of cell executions and creating context-aware prompts that consider both the current notebook state and any previous interactions or commands.\\n\\n7. **Execution Testing**:\\n   - Various cells are used to test the system, ensure that functionality is operating correctly, and demonstrate the capabilities of the conversational agent in a Jupyter context.\\n\\n8. **Error Handling and Validation**:\\n   - The notebook handles potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs for the factorial function) and various elements of cell execution and output display.\\n\\n9. **History Creation and Contextual Responses**:\\n   - An advanced feature is the creation of context-aware prompts that adapt based on the content and history of the notebook, indicating a sophisticated interaction system between user inputs and the agent‚Äôs responses.\\n\\nIn summary, the notebook combines Jupyter\\'s interactive capabilities with an AI-driven agent to assist with tasks, automatically manage notebook content, and potentially perform more complex logical operations based on the commands or tasks provided by the user.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 10, 53, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\n prompt (line, cell)\n\nCell magic to create prompt cells that interact with the AI agent.\n\nwhat this notebook is all about?\n\nThis notebook appears to be part of a system that uses an AI agent to automate tasks within a Jupyter notebook. Here are some key points:\n\nAI Agent Integration: The notebook is integrating a Pydantic AI model, specifically an agent that seems to respond to prompts and perform tasks within the notebook environment.\nFunction Definitions: Several Python functions have been defined:\n\nfactorial(): This function calculates the factorial of a number with input validation.\nhello_world(): A simple function that prints ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.\n\nCell Creation and Management: There are functions and tools implemented to create and manage notebook cells programmatically. For example, the create_cell function uses the IPython‚Äôs API to insert new cells.\nNotebook History Management: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\nHistory-Aware Prompts: Functions like create_history_aware_prompt are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\nTesting and Execution: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\n\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\n\n\n\nlast_prompt_result.all_messages()\n\n[ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Here is the context of new notebook cells that were added:\\nCell[36]:\\nSource:\\nresult.all_messages()\\nOutputs:\\n[{\\'data\\': {\\'text/plain\\': [\\'[ModelRequest(parts=[SystemPromptPart(content=\"\\\\\\\\nYou are a helpful assistant that operates in a Jupyter notebook.\\\\\\\\nYour regular text responses are rendered as cell output.\\\\\\\\nYou can create new cells, edit existing cells, and run code.\\\\\\\\nYou can also use tools to help you with your tasks.\\\\\\\\nToday\\\\\\'s date is 2024-12-31.\\\\\\\\n\", part_kind=\\\\\\'system-prompt\\\\\\'), UserPromptPart(content=\\\\\\'Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number with input validation\\\\\\', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 28, 691513, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind=\\\\\\'user-prompt\\\\\\')], kind=\\\\\\'request\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \\' ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart(tool_name=\\\\\\'create_cell\\\\\\', args=ArgsJson(args_json=\\\\\\'{\"content\":\"def factorial(n):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n with input validation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    :raises ValueError: if n is not a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Input must be an integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Input must be a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        return 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    result = 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        result *= i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    return result\",\"cell_type\":\"code\"}\\\\\\'), tool_call_id=\\\\\\'call_Iuc8vC4Y2axuMDvDh3TlF9mz\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'tool-call\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 29, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \\' ModelRequest(parts=[ToolReturnPart(tool_name=\\\\\\'create_cell\\\\\\', content=\\\\\\'Created new code  with content: def factorial(n):\\\\\\\\n    \"\"\"\\\\\\\\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n with input validation.\\\\\\\\n    :param n: non-negative integer\\\\\\\\n    :return: factorial of n\\\\\\\\n    :raises ValueError: if n is not a non-negative integer\\\\\\\\n    \"\"\"\\\\\\\\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer\")\\\\\\\\n    if n &lt; 0:\\\\\\\\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer\")\\\\\\\\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\\\\\\\n        return 1\\\\\\\\n    result = 1\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        result *= i\\\\\\\\n    return result\\\\\\', tool_call_id=\\\\\\'call_Iuc8vC4Y2axuMDvDh3TlF9mz\\\\\\', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 32, 646314, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), part_kind=\\\\\\'tool-return\\\\\\')], kind=\\\\\\'request\\\\\\'),\\\\n\\', \" ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content=\\'I have created a function to calculate the factorial of a number with input validation.

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\'s API to insert new cells.\\n\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\n\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\n\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\n\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 11, 33, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]\n\n\n\ntell me what have I added last to this notebook?\n\n\"Error processing prompt: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Request too large for gpt-4o in organization org-Pm8WC2pvJDhMF1KkAgUCByZl on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 30000, Requested 62420.

If the input is a negative integer, it raises a `ValueError`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Factorial Calculation**: It calculates the factorial using a recursive approach. The base case is that the factorial of 0 is 1, and for other numbers, it uses the recursive definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\( n! = n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\times (n-1)! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo make use of this function, you would call it with an integer argument, like so:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfactorial(5)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis would return `120`, which is the factorial of 5.

For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s API to insert new cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.\\\\\\', part_kind=\\\\\\'text\\\\\\')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 12, 53, 39, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind=\\\\\\'response\\\\\\')]\\']}, \\'execution_count\\': 23, \\'metadata\\': {}, \\'output_type\\': \\'execute_result\\'}]\\n\\nCell[37]:\\nSource:\\n#| export\\n@notebook_agent.tool\\ndef modify_cell(ctx: RunContext[str], cell_index: int, content: str) -&gt;

Here are some key points:\\n\\n1. **AI Agent Integration**: The notebook is integrating a Pydantic AI model, specifically an agent that seems to respond to prompts and perform tasks within the notebook environment.\\n\\n2. **Function Definitions**: Several Python functions have been defined:\\n   - `factorial()`: This function calculates the factorial of a number with input validation.\\n   - `hello_world()`: A simple function that prints \"Hello, World!\".\\n\\n3. **Cell Creation and Management**: There are functions and tools implemented to create and manage notebook cells programmatically. For example, the `create_cell` function uses the IPython\\'s API to insert new cells.\\n\\n4. **Notebook History Management**: The notebook implements functionality to keep track of the history of executed notebook cells, which can be used to provide context to the AI agent.\\n\\n5. **History-Aware Prompts**: Functions like `create_history_aware_prompt` are used to create prompts that include historical context from the notebook. This allows the AI to make more informed decisions by understanding previous interactions and code.\\n\\n6. **Testing and Execution**: The notebook includes cells dedicated to testing these features, like running the agent with notebook history and testing the factorial function.\\n\\nOverall, it seems to be an experimental setup aiming to enhance interaction with a Jupyter notebook using AI for improved productivity and dynamic task execution.', part_kind='text')], timestamp=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 13, 11, 33, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), kind='response')]",
